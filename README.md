# Probabilistic Matrix Inspection

A Python implementention for the proposed algorithm in the paper **Probabilistic Matrix Inspection and Group Scheduling**.

## Usage

    $ python matrix-inspection.py n m

Where `n` and `m` are the number of lines and columns, respectively.

It will generate a random `n` x `m` matrix of Bernoulli numbers and its matrix of probabilities, and compute its feasibility.

or

    $ python matrix-inspection.py

It will compute the example provided in the paper.
